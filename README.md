# LatencySpy

Is a VST3 x64 pluginproject about a plugin that is reporting if other plugins between 2 Latency Spys are adding more latency PDC Plugin Delay Correction, so that the host/DAW must compensate. The Latency Spy will help you find out which plugins are doing just that additional delay/latency.

This plugin isn't working in Sonar 8 because it doesnt report PDC apparently.

Here is a tutorial over how to use the plugin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeVDHgCQW8c
